# PHP IDE Extensions Helper

This project can build PHP files to be used to generate fake PHP files containing the definitions of constants, interfaces, classes, traits and functions provided by PHP extensions.

The `bin/extract` command will generate or update an XML file that contains the definition of the PHP code.
You can run it multiple times against the same XML file, using different environment (for instance, adding a new PHP extension, running it under a different OS like Windows or POSIX, ...).
Use the `--help` option to get help.

The `extract` command can also be executed inside a Docker image. To do that, simply call `bin/extract-docker`.
Use the `--help` option to get help.

The `bin/generate` command will actually generate the fake PHP files, reading the XML files generated by `bin/extract`.
Use the `--help` option to get help.
